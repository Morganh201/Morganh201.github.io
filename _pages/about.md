I am a 4th year undergraduate math and statistics student at UofT. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in statistics with the goal in pursuing a career in research and/or academia. I am interested in extreme value theory, multivariate analysis and copula methods, spatio-temporal methods, and population models.
